Hi! I'm the first page in your **Airshelf** book. Read me to learn more.

If you want to edit this page, click **Edit Page** above (on the right).

Once you have finished editing, add new pages by clicking **+ Add page** in the Table of Contents to the left on a computer or tablet. If you're on mobile, click **Table of Contents** above first to open the table of contents.

## Pages

Airshelf stores your pages on the Internet which means all your pages are automatically saved and accessible from any computer, phone or tablet with Internet access.

* Sample list item
* Another list item that is super super extra long. It has to be long enough that it overflows into the next line so that we can see how multiple lines look. The spacing should still look okay.
* And a list item

### Add a page

Click **Add page** in the Table of Contents to add a page.

If you're on mobile or have a small screen, click **Table of Contents** above first to open it.

### Navigating to other pages

All your pages are listed in the **Table of Contents**. You can switch to another page by clicking on the title of a page.

### Organize pages

Drag and drop pages using your mouse or a track pad in the Table of Contents to move them around. Drag a page on top of another to create a sub-page or nested page.

If you are using a touch interface like a phone or tablet, click the **Pencil icon** in the Table of Contents first. Then drag the **Three bars icon** to move a page around.

### Rename a page

The name of the page in the **Table of Contents** is taken from the title at the top of each page.

To rename a page, edit the page, and change the title and the changed name will be reflected in the **Table of Contents**.

### Delete a page

You can delete the current page by clicking the **Page icon** above to open the page menu. Then click **Delete this page**. If you mistakenly deleted a page, you can **Undelete pages** from the same menu. You can also **Archive a page**. The difference is that archived pages can still be viewed but won't show up in the table of contents.`
