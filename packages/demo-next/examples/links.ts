export default `## Links Spanning Lines

The [Beginning](https://wysimark.com/) of the line positioning and having these close or near the [End of line](https://wysimark.com)

The [Links](https://wysimark.com/) in the editor should work fine even in the case of [Spanning multiple lines inside a paragraph](https://wysimark.com)

[A single link that spans across multiple lines should also be something that works fine inside of Wysimark](https://wysimark.com/) 

Also, a [link that starts not at the begining of a line but the end of the link is horizontally past the begining of the link](https://wysimark.com) should also work fine.

A [link](https://with-an-unusually-long-url/should/still/look/ok-in-dialog) with a long URL.
